In the January Workbench Working Group meeting we decided that we wanted to solicit community feedback on how we might group entries in the Workbench docs navigation.
We have created a template for you to first copy and then add in small or large changes to the current Workbench docs navigation. This template optionally allows you to display your changes side by side to the current navigation. You may also want to suggest the renaming of section names, but please put in a comment with the original section name, or if you combine more than one section into a new section also list them all,

Here is Mark’s first version of a potential change in the docs navigation to give people an idea of how to submit your suggestions.
